The tool you are describing would be a keyword suggestion and analysis tool for Amazon. Here's a breakdown of its features and functionality:

Keyword Suggestion: The tool takes a main keyword as input and generates a list of relevant keyword suggestions based on Amazon's search data. These suggestions can help sellers and marketers identify popular search terms related to their product.

BSR (Best Sellers Rank) Checking: The tool then retrieves the search results for each suggested keyword and analyzes the BSR for each product. BSR represents a product's sales performance relative to other items in its category on Amazon. It serves as an indicator of popularity and demand.

Sorting by BSR: After gathering the BSR data for each product, the tool organizes the results in a table format, sorting the keywords from the minimum BSR (indicating high demand) to the highest BSR (indicating lower demand). This ranking enables users to identify keywords that are associated with popular and potentially profitable products.

Additional Data: The tool can also provide additional information alongside the BSR, such as results, and bsr. This data can help users make informed decisions about keyword targeting and product selection.

Overall, this tool assists sellers and marketers in optimizing their Amazon product listings by suggesting relevant keywords and providing insights into market demand through BSR analysis. By sorting the results in a table, users can easily identify high-potential keywords and prioritize them for their marketing strategies.
